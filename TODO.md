# To Do

- Come up with an ordering for the books based on popularity, quality, etc.
- Tell the user if a word is not in the index.
- Assign categories to more books.
- Filter books with spelling errors.
- Include [Collections](https://tarheelreader.org/collections/) so that even
  without JavaScript readers can have curated sets.
